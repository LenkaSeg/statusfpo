Ticket: 12603

We will be moving services and applications from our IAD2 datacenter to a new RDU3 one.

End user services such as: docs, mirrorlists, dns, pagure.io, torrent, fedorapeople, fedoraproject.org website, and tier0 download server will be unaffected and should continue to work normally through the outage window.

Other services may be up and down during the outage window.

Contributors are advised to wait until after the outage window to resume work and report issues with services.

Update 2025-07-01 01:00UTC:

Many services have been migrated, but there's still a number to bring up and validate.
Tomorrow the buildsystem (koji) and related services will be migrated, then will we
work to bring everything on line. Thanks again for everyone's patience during this move.

Please be aware that CentOS infrastructure may be affected by the move as well.
