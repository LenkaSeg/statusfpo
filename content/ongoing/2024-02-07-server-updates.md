Title: Server updates/reboots

Ticket: 11754

We will be applying updates and rebooting servers.
No one service should be down long, but may be up and down in the outage window.
Additionally, as time permits we will be doing the following additional work:
* resizing disks on database servers
* moving some database servers to rhel9 and newer postgresql
* applying some firmware updates

21:20 - Unfortunately some updates got applied early to the koji builders,
so builds may be affected and it looks like the outage is starting
early. Sorry for the trouble.
