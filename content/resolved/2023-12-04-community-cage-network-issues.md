Ticket: 

The ISP related to the Fedora community cage is likely affected by a fiber cut
in North Carolina. This situation appears to be causing routing issues from
certain locations to the hosted machines, impacting various parts of the Fedora
site.

The service is fully restored. The outage was due to a cut fiber that
required repair.
