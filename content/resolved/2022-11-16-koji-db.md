Title: koji db issues

At about 8UTC the koji database server became unresponsive. 
We have rebooted it, but load is not coming back under control. 
We are intestigating the loading issues. Until them koji and associated
applications (bodhi, etc) will be slow or down. 

The database issues seem to have been caused by a large number of 
expensive database queries coming from a remote ip. We have blocked this
ip address and brought everything back up. We will look further 
for mitigation of this sort of issue moving forward.
