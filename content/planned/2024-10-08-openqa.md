Ticket: 12206

We will be reinstalling some openqa virthost and database hosts as well as
reinstalling workers to use a common partitioning and networking setup.

This outage impacts 
[openqa](https://openqa.fedoraproject.org/) and openqa-labs. During the
outage, updates may not go stable; waiting for testing. After the outage is
over, openqa will test all pending updates (no need to resubmit).
